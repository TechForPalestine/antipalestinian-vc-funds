[South Africa's invocation of the Genocide
Convention](https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf)
thoroughly documents Israel's genocide in Gaza. This genocide has been supported
since October 7th by hundreds of VCs, who continue to keep their names on a
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTc_OIs8MSVxqz0To2diHiDd_UIQBg_wBHLnmIQNtoTRQaFrC2ZcUWiOqR7dHMe2KnfnU-Bi7n-1XpW/pub)
supporting Israel's actions, and continue to publicly endorse for Israel's
genocide of the people of Gaza.

Founders, LPs, tech employees, and even many VCs have expressed to us their
outrage at these firms' continued support for Israel throughout the genocide:

- Founders have told us they cannot work with firms whose values support
  Israel's genocide, and in many cases which have partners publicly and
  continually advocating for it on social media. They do not wish to make more
  money for these firms.

- LPs such as pension funds whose members are actively organizing against
  genocide have told us they wish not to invest in VC funds who continue to
  support the genocide.

- LPs such as sovereign wealth funds with Arab, Gulf, and Muslim partners
  have told us they will never invest in the firms who support the genocide of
  their people.

- LPs and founders have also said they are shocked at the poor judgement of
  these firms, who signed knowing Israel's long history of abuse of the
  Palestinian people, the likelihood of extreme violence -- which has now
  occurred. This poor judgement will damage these funds' reputation, along with
  their ability to continue to raise capital and invest in great companies in the
  future.

- Tech employees including sought after engineers have said that they wish to
  work for companies with good values, and now actively track the values of the
  investors of the companies they choose to work for.

- Venture Capitalists at the firms who signed have told us they felt pressured
  to sign, but feel they will experience repercussions in the industry for
  removing their firm's name from the pro-Israel list.

- Students protesting on campus have asked us to prepare a list of firms their
  Universities should divest from

## About this list

These founders, LPs, tech employees, and VCs of conscience, have asked us to
compile a simple list so they may know which VC firms to avoid.

VCs on this list are taken from the original support document, from the
documentary work at [genocide.vc](https://genocide.vc), from the [Tech Mission
to
Israel](https://theintercept.com/2023/12/19/investors-israel-tech-mission-harvard/),
and from other public statements made by VC partners and leaders.

We will periodically update this list when VCs remove themselves from the
[pro-Israeli
list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTc_OIs8MSVxqz0To2diHiDd_UIQBg_wBHLnmIQNtoTRQaFrC2ZcUWiOqR7dHMe2KnfnU-Bi7n-1XpW/pub)
(which can be done by emailing
[VCCommunity@seasideventures.com](mailto:VCCommunity@seasideventures.com)), or
publicly retract and apologize for their statements, and support the humanity of
the Palestinian people. We welcome these VCs to make PRs directly
on this repository when that happens.

# Run the tracker

There is a little cheerio/node script which you can use to generate a string array of VC names which are still signatories to the aforementioned document. Just make sure you have node installed then run the following command:

```bash
# Install the dependencies if you haven't already
> npm i
# Run the script
> npm run track_genocide_vcs
```

This script will be used to track any revocations of signatures and subsequently update the table below.

# Contribute

We welcome PRs to:

- add investors at VC firms who make statements that supports Israel's war on the people of Gaza
- to update rows to reflect a change in that support
- or to add metadata and further documentary support to existing data
