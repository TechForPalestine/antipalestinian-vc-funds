# antipalestinian-vc-funds

South Africa's TODO documents Israel's genocide in Gaza. This genocide has been
supported since October 7th by hundreds of VCs, who continue to keep their names
on a [document]() supporting Israel's actions, and continue to publicly endorse
for Israel's genocide of the people of Gaza.

Founders, LPs, tech employees, and even many VCs have expressed to us their
outrage at these firms' continued support for Israel throughout the genocide:

- Founders have told us they cannot work with firms whose values support
  Israel's genocide, and in many cases wich have partners publicly and continually
  advocating for it on social media. They do not wish to make more money for these
  firms.

- LPs such as pension funds whose members are actively organizing against
  genocide have told us they wish not to invest in VC funds who continue to
  support the genocode

- LPs in funds and sovereign wealth funds with Arab, Gulf, and Muslim partners
  have told us they will never invest in the firms who support the genocide of
  their people.

- LPs and founders have also said they are shocked at the poor judegement of
  these firms, who signed knowing Israel's long history of abuse of the
  Palestinian people, the likelyhood of extreme violence -- which has now
  occurred. This poor judgement reflects poorly on the business skills of the
  firms involved, and harms dealflow from valuable founders.

- Tech employees have said that they wish to work for companies with values, and
  now actively track the investors of the companies they choose to work for.

- Venture Capitalists at the firms who signed have told us they felt pressured
  to sign, but do not feel they have sufficient cover to remove their names.

## About the list

These founders, LPs, tech employees, and VCs of conscience, have asked us to
compile a simple list so they may know which VC firms to avoid.

VCs on this list are taken from the original support document, from the
documentary work at [genocide.vc](https://genocide.vc), and from other public
statements made by VC partners and leaders.

We will periodically update this list when VCs remove themselves from the
[original
list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTc_OIs8MSVxqz0To2diHiDd_UIQBg_wBHLnmIQNtoTRQaFrC2ZcUWiOqR7dHMe2KnfnU-Bi7n-1XpW/pub)
(which can be done by emailing
[VCCommunity@seasideventures.com](mailto:VCCommunity@seasideventures.com)), or
publicly retract and apologize for their statements and support the humanity of
the people of the Palestinian people. We welcome these VCs to make PRs directly
on this repository when that happens.

# Contribute

We welcome PRs to add investors at VC firms who make statements that supports
Israe's war on the people of Gaza, to update rows to reflect a change in that
support, or to add metadata and further documentary support.
